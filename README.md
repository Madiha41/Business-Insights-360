# Power BI 360 Business Insights

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Power BI, covering finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive insights for AtliQ Hardware. It aims to facilitate data-driven decision-making and enhance business strategies.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is expanding its operations globally and recently ventured into the Latin American market by opening its own stores. However, this expansion led to significant financial losses due to decisions based on intuition and limited data insights, as the company relied heavily on Excel sheets for its analysis. These tools proved inadequate for comprehensive data analytics.

In response to this challenge, AtliQ's senior executives decided to initiate a data analytics project to facilitate data-driven decision-making. The goal is to leverage advanced data analytics to gain actionable insights and enhance their business strategy.
